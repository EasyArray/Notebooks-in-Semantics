    "We can consider meanings ways of conveying information about the world. In other worlds, when I know something about the world, and I want you to know the same thing, I use a sentence whose meaning conveys this knowledge. \n",
    "\n",
    "But what is such *knowledge about the world*? It must be almost unimaginably complex &emdash; it would be very difficult, for instance, to write down everything you know about the world. On the other hand, it also must be incomplete: no one knows everything about the world. Instead, we store some sort of imperfect *model* of the world in our minds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we can begin our exploration of semantics with imperfect models of the world (or perhaps models of human *models* of the world!). To that end we will make the simplying assumption that knowledge of the world can be modeled using *relations* over *individuals*.\n",

    "In these notebooks, we will represent individuals as single capital letters (in the Latin alphabet). Of course, there are more than 26 individuals in the world, but our examples will always be restricted in practice to a handleful at a time, so 26 will suffice. The set of individuals in a model is known as its *domain*, and hence our domain will be the set of letters from `A` to `Z`. \n",

    "Even with the ellipsis notation, it can be tedious to write out the domain every time we want to use it. Instead, we can assign this set as the value of a *variable*. A variable looks just like a constant (one without quotes), but it does not evaluate to its own name; rather, it retrieves a value set earlier. Python assigns values to variables using the single equal sign operator `=`. Note that assignments are a special type of python code called a `statement` that produces no output, but performs some action. In this case, the action is assigning a value to a variable. Python can also delete variables using the keyword `del` as in `del DOMAIN`.\n",
